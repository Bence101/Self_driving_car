Welcome to my simulation! Below you can find some useful tips:
- You can tweak the simulation in many ways. Check the init.js file!
- You can change the NN structure in the brain.js. Smallest NN-s usually better.
- With the original parameters a finisher car will emerge in the first 10-20 generation in the majority of the cases.
- If you register to this site (https://editor.p5js.org/), you can copy the project and save your changes.


-- About the AI:
  - I do not use Neat, only a very simple neural network.
  - The cars evolve based on only selection by fitness and mutation. No crossover used.
  - The best car is always revived into the new generation unchanged.
